# Virtual Pizza Place

The assignment for this project was to build a program that based on the user´s input would determine the chosen food type and based on age create the appropriate order for a child or adult.

## The problem

I approached this project step by step by using the comments to guide me.
To interact with the user I used function calls prompt() and alert().
To make decisions based on the user´s input I used conditional statements 'if-else' and a 'switch'

If I had more time I would have made the user interface more visually appealing and user-friendly.
Also implemented more error handling and validation.
